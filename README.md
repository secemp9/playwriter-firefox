## Comparison

### BrowserMCP

Playwriter has access to the full playwright API available, it can send any CDP command via the playwright methods. It only uses 1 tool `execute` to send playwright code snippets. This means that the LLM can reuse its knowledge about playwright and less context window is used to expose browser automations tools.

Playwriter is also more capable because it exposes the full playwright API instead of only a few tools.
